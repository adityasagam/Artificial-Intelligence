Eval function:
1. Any combination of a single piece of a player and 3 zeroes gives 0.25 points in each combination of 4 numbers in a row
    for ex 0001, 0010, 0100, 1000 give 0.25 points. Same goes for player 2
2. Any combination of 2 pieces of a player and 2 zeroes in a group of 4 numbers gives 0.5 points
    for ex. 0011, 1100, 0220 etc
3. Any combination of 3 peices of a player and 1 zero in a group of 4 numbers gives 0.75 points
    for ex. 2220, 1101 etc
4. For each of the arrangements above the orientation can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.
5. A 4 in a row gives 1 point to the respective user (same as utility)
6. The eval function now gives the difference of the eval scores achieved as a result of the above occurences of pieces.
    For player 1: eval = player1 score - player2 score
    For player 2: eval = player2 score - player1 score
